Azure have 3 kinds of roles 

Web Role
Worker Role
VM  Role


6. Briefly explain the virtual machine scale sets ?

a compute resource which is used for the deployment and the management of a pair of twin
VMs, they are designed with the similar configuration for true autoscale. There is no special need for VMs pre-provisioning and simple for services of large scale, they concentrate on workload of containerised, big data.

7. Make a note about availability sets ?

This set is VMs logical group, which helps us to find how our application is built in Azure that offers availability, to get highly availability for application it is suggested that two or multiple VMs are designed in the sets of availability which leads to the Azure SLA at 99.95. If we use single VMs along with the storage of Azure premium, then for the maintenance of unplanned events Azure SLA is used. 

8. Introduce fault domains.

They are nothing but the logical groups belonging to hardware, which can share the same network and power source. They are used to rack the data centers on premise, when we designed our VMs with help of availability sets then these fault domains are automatically distributed by the platform of Azure. The failures of physical hardware, outgages of network, etc are limited by this approach. 

9. Introduce Update domains.

a hardware logical group which can be maintained or rebooted at the similar time, these updated domains automatically distribute our VMs when we design VM in the set of availability. This process is used to ensure our application instance and it keeps running as a platform of azure that goes under the maintenance of periodic. We can robot only a single order of updated domain at a time, it may not continuously proceed while the maintenance. 

10. Briefly explain about Network security groups ?

NSG includes the access control list which may permit or neglect the traffic of a network for subnets, they may be associated with an NIC of individuals that connect with a subnet or with the subnets. If a subnet is associated with an NSG then a subnet ACL is applied for VM, it also limits the traffic for an individual NIC with the help of NSG. 

11. Are Scale sets works with availability sets of Azure ?

Yes, it is an inferred set of availability, which contains 5 update domains and 5 fault domains. Its VMs span is more than 100, that is equal to various sets of availability. VMs set of availability is present in the same network, VMs control node is created by the common configuration in sets of availability.
